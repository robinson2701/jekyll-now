    <td>I learnt by reading the manual in detail and discovering everything the programme has to offer. I cooperated with my partner discussing the ins and outs of what we should do. We each took turns on the keyboard to keep us interested. Reading back in the manual was effective if I was in doubt about something. The breadboard was a very hard thing to achieve success, it would of helped if the image on the manual was clearer.

    <td>To keep full attention on the programme and not things around it. I lost a bit of concentration and patience when we could not understand the coding at the start but once I figured it out it got better. (I got impatient as many people were on the robotic arms and I thought that it was cool)!</td>

    <td>Co-operate with partner a bit more and suggest even more ideas to how we can make it work in order for us to succeed like we did today. It will improve my learning as I will learn and discover things I never knew existed in coding and understand the makings around a piece of software, that lights up! </td>
