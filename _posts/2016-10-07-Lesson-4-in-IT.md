    <td>I learnt a lot in the lesson as I was cooperative and listened to the instructions given. Me and my partner took turns writing and speaking about the Fuze box. I also asked questions that were appropriate to the lesson to help figure out what I had to do. Tip. Even if you do not like coding still give it your best shot and hope for the best. It is very rewarding when you do something cool and right to do with code especially on exercises on Fuze Box.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mainly there is only one habit. Providing enough information for my partner on the code we are doing to help go faster and also the most important thing, to learn. This will help us learn as we actually then have an idea on what we're doing instead of just doing some random coding.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will give more information to my partner and go through the tips. This will enable me to comprehend more things about coding which is very important as that is our main focus for the whole of this half term. Also to save work in a file or document when we are done so if I run the system and it does not work I will have a backup for working on!!</td>
