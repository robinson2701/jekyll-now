    <td>My partner and I worked well. We swapped roles so none of us got bored and we also discussed what we should do when we were struggling. We listened to each other and read the Fuze Book thoroughly. We picked up vital information so therefore we could go on to soe new coding. </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to stop helping others and looking at my blog too often. This slows me down and does not allow others to learn (as well as me). I need to focus more on the task given to make the lesson more effective for the benefit of myself and my learning. Also I need to stop giving up when the going gets tough!</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>We will bring in a memory stick to save our work. This will allow us to get on to new and exciting things and broaden my knowledge in the world of computing and coding. I will not give up (particularly on the breadboard), this will enable me to get on to new things and maybe make me happy with myself! I will also not be distracted as much as I have been!!!</td>
