    <td>I learnt by reading the manual in detail and discovering everything the programme has to offer. I cooperated with my partner discussing the ins and outs of what we should do. We each took turns on the keyboard to keep us interested. Reading back in the manual was effective if I was in doubt about something.

    <td>Co-operate with partner a bit more and suggest even more ideas to how we can make it work in order for us to succeed like we did today. It will improve my learning as I will learn and discover things I never knew existed in coding and understand the makings around a piece of software.  </td>
