Year 8 IT has been very fun. My favourite part is Fuze Box. This is where we made games on these systems in partners. I enjoyed it, because it was interesting and fun. We have also done Codecademy. I got very far in this and some of the levels were fun for instance 'Battleships'. You had to guess the computer's number to win. I got lucky and completed it first time! The only problem with Codecademy was that it sometimes got repetitive and I also gave up too easily on many tasks I was more than capable to complete. We also took care of our Github posts and Blogs. I kept up to date with them and wrote a lot in them, although when we were doing Codecademy I mostly wrote the same things because I did the same in every lesson. Overall, I enjoyed Year 8 IT because it was interesting and some bits were fun especially Fuze Box and the robot. Yes, we built and controlled a robot using wires and code. Pretty cool, right?
