  <tr>
    <td>I worked individually and effectively by focusing on my work and to keep going when I find a code hard. Also to try coding that might not work but has some sense to it. I did not do that last week when I think I should of.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I need to keep practising my code and to get further into Python because although I am doing the code right sometimes I can work at a slow rate and may need to get quicker. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will improve my work by going faster and ask the teacher more to enhance my learning during the time with Python Code. This will be good because I like how the system works when the code works!!!</td>
