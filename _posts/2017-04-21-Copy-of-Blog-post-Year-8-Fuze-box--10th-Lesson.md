    <td>I worked well because I was interested to start something new. I listened to the teacher to not only do the work set, but to do it confidently and on my own. We worked individually and concentrated on the task set.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to stop helping others and looking at my blog too often. This slows me down and does not allow others to learn (as well as me). I need to focus more on the task given to make the lesson more effective for the benefit of myself and my learning. Also I need to stop giving up when the going gets tough!</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?


I will keep to my own device and task and concentrate on what I need to do. Hopefully I will reach the target set next lesson!</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We will bring in a memory stick to save our work. This will allow us to get on to new and exciting things and broaden my knowledge in the world of computing and coding. I will not give up (particularly on the breadboard), this will enable me to get on to new things and maybe make me happy with myself! I will also not be distracted as much as I have been!!!</td>
