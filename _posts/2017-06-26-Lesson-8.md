    <td>I knew what I had to do coming into the lesson and got it done by working hard and asking the teacher for help when I rarely got confused on a line or topic in my work. I worked efficiently and quickly to be able to, as well as carry on CodeCademy test if my blog was working because github have changed a few things causing page failures, warnings and problems.
This time I had to look at my blog and work on it because the teacher instructed us to do so.</td>
